"In Pavlovian conditioning, the failure of a CR to appear as a result of prior presentation of the CS in the absence of the US.",Latent inhibition,ON,bl
"The statement that behavior is a function of its consequences. So called because the strength of a behavior depends on its past effects on the environment. Implicit in the law is the notion that operant learning is an active process, since it is usually the behavior of the organism that, directly or indirectly, produces the effect.",Law of effect,ON,bl
The tendency to give up on a problem as a result of previous exposure to insoluble problems. In experiments the problem typically involves escape learning.,Learned helplessness,ON,bl
