What is Hart and Risley (1995) and what did they discover about parent-child interactions and language?,"Longitudinal study that found that as parent-child interactions increased, children's vocabulary growth also increased",ON,bl
"What is Madsen, Becker, and Thomas (1968) and what principle did they use to change disruptive students behavior?","They only reinforced desired behavior (e.g., sitting still) and ignored undesired behavior (e.g., running around). The desired behavior was incompatible with the undesired behavior. This principle is known as Differential Reinforcement of Incompatible Behavior (DRI).
",ON,bl
What is Skinner’s philosophy on learning?,"Skinner believed in ""Errorless Learning"", the idea that mistakes interfere with true learning.",ON,bl
"What is Lovaas and Simmons (1969) and their experiments with John, the boy who hit himself?",Lovaas and Simmons (1969) shocked John whenever he hit himself. The undesired behavior decreased in frequency (almost instantly).,ON,bl
What is Alford (1986) and how did he get his patient to get rid of the “haggly old witch”?,"Alford (1986) had his patient keep a therapy log. Inside the log, the patient recorded how much he believed the delusion was really happening on a scale from 0 (witch is my imagination) to 100 (witch is real). Alford (1986) then reinforced instances of ""witch doubting"", and over time, the patient believed the witch was real less and less.",ON,bl
What is constraint-induced movement therapy and the general principle behind it?,"CIMT is the idea of forcing patients to use damaged upper limbs to perform a variety of motor tasks. This is achieved by placing the ""good arm"" in a sling. Results suggest that strength and dexterity in the affected limb improve over time.",ON,bl
"What is the general principle behind Austin et al., (1996) and how did they improve worker safety?","Austin et al., (1996) provided visual and verbal feedback to roofers on a daily basis. There was a financial incentive for the workers to remain safe, which when combined with daily safety ratings remarkably improved overall worker safety.",ON,bl
What is Thorndike (1898) and his experiment with the observer cat and the puzzle box?,"Thorndike (1898) allowed one cat to escape from the puzzle box, and allowed another cat to observe. When he placed the observer cat inside the puzzle box, the observer cat made all the same mistakes as the first cat, giving the appearance that animals cannot learn via observation.",ON,bl
What is Herbert and Harsh (1944) and the cats with the turntable?,"Herbert and Harsh (1944) placed food on a turntable and allowed one cat to spin the wheel to get the food while the other cats observed. There were three conditions: no observation, observing all 30 trials, or observing only the last 15 trials. The main results were that observing all 30 trials resulted in the best learning for the observers, which suggests that watching mistakes are beneficial to the learning process.",ON,bl
What is Kanfer and Marston (1963) and the “human noun” experiment?,"Kanfer and Marston (1963) had adults say the first word that came to mind, and then those same adults heard what they thought were other participants saying words as well. The twist was that it was all a recording, and the experimenters provided verbal praise (e.g., ""Good"") whenever the other ""participants"" said a human noun (e.g., ""boy""). The result was that the actual participants started saying more and more human nouns over the course of the experiment.",ON,bl
What is the difference between social and asocial learning?,"Social learning involves an actual model, whereas asocial learning does not.",ON,bl
What is Thompson and Russell (2004) and the “ghost mat” experiment?,"We discussed several versions of this experiment, all of which involved placing a toy on a mat. In one of the experiments, the correct solution was to push the mat away from you in order to get the toy. Children learned the solution better if a series of invisible strings performed the solution rather than by observing an actual model observe the solution.",ON,bl
"What is Lyons, Young, and Keil (2007) and the imitation study with the jar and the feather?","These experimenters put a toy inside a jar, and then proceeded to rub the top of the jar with the feather before opening it. They then asked the children which of the actions were necessary and which were ""silly"", and provided corrective feedback. The experimenters again tapped the jar with the feather before opening it, and then left the room and allowed the child to open the jar. Children almost always imitated the adults and repeated the unnecessary steps.",ON,bl
What is Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory and the steps required to learn via observation?,"Attention, Retention, Motor-Reproductive, and Motivation",ON,bl
What is Watson and Rayner (1920) and how did they provide evidence for generalization?,"Little Albert was trained to fear white rabbits, but his fear generalized to other white furry objects (e.g., cotton).",ON,bl
What is Guttman and Kalish (1956) and the generalization gradient?,"Pigeons were trained to peck at a particular color disc, but during the test phase, pigeons will not only peck at that same colored disc but they will also peck at similarly colored discs. The important point is that the pecking rate reflects how similar the colors are (or how similar the training stimulus is compared to the test stimulus). The more similar the two, the higher the pecking rate.",ON,bl
What is Eisenberger and Masterson (1983) and the anagram study?,"Some participants were given difficult anagrams during the acquisition phase, others were given easy anagrams (or no anagrams at all). During the test phase, impossible anagrams were given to all participants, and the experimenters measured how long participants persisted before cheating. Results suggest that those initially given difficult anagrams persisted for a longer duration before cheating.",ON,bl
What is the general idea behind discrimination training (what is it and what does it involve)?,"Discrimination training involves training an animal to respond to certain stimuli and ignore others (e.g., peck at this yellowish-green disc but ignore this red disc).",ON,bl
What is the “Differential Outcomes Effect”?,"Any experimental setup in which there are different rewards depending on the particular stimulus presented and the response given. For example, Trapold (1970) had two levers in a chamber, one of which was reinforced with sugar water and one of which was reinforced with food depending upon the environmental conditions present (light on or tone playing). When differential rewards are used, learning is faster than when only one reward is used.",ON,bl
"What is the Lit, Schweitzer, and Oberbauer (2011) study with bomb sniffing dogs?","Handlers were told that a piece of red tape marks a bomb location, and this caused the dogs to have a dramatic increase in the number of false alarms during the test phase (no bombs were actually present).",ON,bl
What is “stimulus control”?,"Any stimulus that causes a particular response that is the result of discrimination training. For instance, we have been trained to stop at the red light, slow down at the yellow light, and continue driving during the green light.",ON,bl
What is Spence (1937) and Kohler (1939) and concept learning in animals?,"Spence (1937) taught chimps to peck at the larger of two discs, and Kohler (1939) had chicks peck at the lighter of two gray squares. This demonstrates that animals can learn basic concepts.",ON,bl
What is Herrnstein and Loveland (1964) and the humans in photographs experiment?,"Herrnstein and Loveland (1964) taught pigeons to peck at photographs that only had human beings in them. Pigeons were able to grasp this complex concept, and even corrected the experimenters occasionally!",ON,bl
What is Penfield (1952) and what happened during electrical stimulation of the temporal lobes?,"Penfield (1952) demonstrated that some patients experienced vivid recall of ""long-forgotten memories"" when he stimulated the temporal lobes with a small amount of electrical current.",ON,bl
What is “free recall”?,"A type of recall that provides no cues (e.g., recall all the US Presidents).",ON,bl
What is “cued recall”?,"A type of recall that provides some type of cue (e.g., casa - ???)",ON,bl
What is “recognition”?,"A type of test wherein the correct answer is presented amongst incorrect answers (i.e., ""lures"") and the participant must recognize which answer is correct.",ON,bl
What is the Standing (1973) experiment and what level of accuracy was reached?,"Standing (1973) presented participants with 10,000 pictures and observed memory performance after a 2-day delay via a forced-choice recognition test. Participants were able to recognize approximately 83% of the pictures!",ON,bl
What is Ebbinghaus (1885) and the savings method?,"Ebbinghaus (1885) memorized lists of nonsense syllables and then measured how long it would take him to relearn the lists after various delays. If he relearned the list at a faster rate compared to his prior rate, he had only forgotten some of the information over the delay. If it took him just as many trials to relearn the list as it did to originally learn the list, then he considered the list completely forgotten as there was no net savings.",ON,bl
What is the “extinction method”?,"The ""extinction method"" refers to training an animal on a specific task (e.g., a pigeon to peck at a disc). After the task is well-learned, the experimenter starts extinguishing the behavior (e.g., pecking at the disc no longer produces a food reinforcer). The key is that the extinction phase starts either immediately or after a delay (e.g., 1 month). The pecking rates can then be compared between the two delays (immediately versus after a delay) to gauge forgetting. If the pecking rates are about the same, then little forgetting has occurred. If the pigeon pecks less frequently after the delay, forgetting is assumed to have occurred.",ON,bl
What is Gagné (1941) and why is the assumption behind it wrong?,"Gagné (1941) had rats learn a maze, and then they relearned the maze after various delays. The longer the delay, the more trials it took the rat to relearn the maze. The assumption is that the memory of the maze had ""faded"" over time, but time cannot explain anything!",ON,bl
"What is “permastore” and Bahrick et al., (1975)?","Some information, according to Bahrick et al., (1975), enters ""permanent storage"" and is never forgotten. One piece of evidence for this is the fact that people remember their high school classmates for up to 50 years later with fairly high accuracy!",ON,bl
What is De Groot (1966) and how was memory for chess positions?,"De Groot (1966) presented novices and masters with chess positions and tested their memory. The masters remembered the positions much better, and this demonstrates that the masters had more prior knowledge that aided their recall of the positions.",ON,bl
What is proactive versus retroactive interference?,Proactive interference refers to any situation in which old information interferes with your ability to recall newer information. Retroactive interference refers to newer information interfering with your ability to recall older information.,ON,bl
What is Loftus (1974) and the “misinformation effect”?,"Loftus (1974) had participants watch a video of a car crash, and then changed the wording involved in a series of post-questions. Some participants got the phrase ""smashed into each other"" and others got the phrase ""contacted each other"". Those receiving the phrasing ""smashed into each other"" claimed there was broken glass on the scene and overestimated how fast the cars were traveling during the accident.",ON,bl
What are the main results from Tyron (1940)?,"Tyron (1940) demonstrated that heredity plays a role in learning. He bred the smartest rats with the smartest rats, and the worst-performing rats with the worst-performing rats. He did this for 18 generations, and over time, there were remarkable average differences in learning ability between the two types of rats.",ON,bl
What is a “critical period”?,"A ""critical period"" is any important developmental period in which particular things are critical to learn for an animal (e.g., language or social skills). If these things are not learned within the critical period, they may never be learned at all.",ON,bl
What is “instinctive drift”?,"""Instinctive drift"" is the idea that certain innate tendencies can interfere with learning. In other words, certain innate action patterns are very difficult to override, even with lots of training.",ON,bl
What is the Garcia and Koelling (1966) experiment?,"Garcia and Koelling (1966) presented rats with bright, noisy, and tasty water that was ultimately followed by either illness (X-radiation) or shock. Later, Garcia and Koelling (1966) presented rats with bright-noisy water or tasty water, and the results indicated that rats took fewer sips of the bright-noisy water when it had been paired with shock. Conversely, the rats took fewer sips of the tasty water when it had been paired with illness.",ON,bl
