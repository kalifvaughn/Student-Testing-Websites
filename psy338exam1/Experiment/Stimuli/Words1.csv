"What are ""savings""?",a measure of memory developed by Ebbinghaus that refers to the reduction in learning trials needed to learn some set of information due to previous learning trials,ON,bl

What is external validity?,how well an experiment generalizes to the real world,ON,bl
How do neurons communicate?,neurons fire via action potentials (an all-or-none reaction of a neuron that occurs when stimulation reaches some critical threshold value) and send signals to other neurons via neurotransmitters,ON,bl
What is the cerebral cortex responsible for?,"the outer shell of the brain that comprises the majority of the forebrain and is made up of billions of neurons; responsible for higher-level mental processes such as memory, attention, and language.",ON,bl
What is the midbrain responsible for?,a small brain region dorsal to the hindbrain that controls some sensory reactions and relates to overall brain arousal,ON,bl
What is the hindbrain responsible for?,the brain region that lies under the base of the skull and controls basic life functions,ON,bl
What is top-down processing?,"the identification of a stimulus with the help of context, previous knowledge, and/or expectations",ON,bl
What is bottom-up processing?,the identification of a stimulus through the assembly of its component features,ON,bl
What is synesthesia?,experiences in which input from one sensory system produces an experience not only in that modality but in another as well,ON,bl
What is the McGurk Effect?,"a speech perception effect in which visual information conflicts with auditory signals, changing the perceived speech sound",ON,bl
What is subliminal perception?,the purported tendency to be influenced by stimuli presented below the level of awareness,ON,bl
What is supraliminal perception?,above the threshold of conscious awareness,ON,bl
What is the Early-Selection Theory of Attention?,Broadbent (1958) claimed that only information that was directly attended to would be processed for meaning; everything else was filtered out before meaningful processing took place,ON,bl
What is the Late-Selection Theory of Attention?,"Deutsch and Deutsch (1963) claimed that all information was processed for meaning, but only information that was attended to would enter our conscious awareness",ON,bl
What is the Load Theory of Attention?,This theory of attention claims that we can alternate between early- and late-selection depending upon our current perceptual load,ON,bl
What is the Bottleneck Theory of Attention?,Bottleneck theory claims that only one task can be processed at a time (serial processing),ON,bl
What is the Capacity Theory of Attention?,"Capacity theory claims that multiple tasks can be processed simultaneously, but only if there are sufficient resources available.",ON,bl
What is the stimulus-onset asynchrony?,"The SOA refers to the temporal delay between stimulus 1 and stimulus 2, and is used in divided attention research. The closer stimulus 2 follows stimulus 1, the longer it will take to process.",ON,bl
What is the modal-model of memory?,"the information-processing view of memory that postulates a series of chronologically arranged stages through which incoming information passes (sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory)",ON,bl
What are the main characteristics of short-term memory?,the set of processes that we use to hold and rehearse information that occupies our current awareness; short-term memory is limited in both capacity and duration,ON,bl
What are the main characteristics of long-term memory?,"the representations of experiences, knowledge, and skills that we have accumulated throughout our lifetimes; LTM is thought to have unlimited capacity and duration",ON,bl
What is the difference between perception and sensation?,"Perception is the psychological processes involved in the organization and interpretation of sensations, whereas sensation is the physiological processes associated with the intake of sensory information",ON,bl
What is the difference between Broca's Aphasia and Wernicke's Aphasia?,"Broca's aphasia is a language disorder that tends to make language production difficult, whereas Wernicke's aphasia is a language disorder that tends to impair language comprehension ",ON,bl
What is the cocktail party phenomenon?,"This refers to the fact that we can often hear our name spoken in a noisy environment, which seems to suggest that certain information can be processed for meaning even if we are not directly attending to it",ON,bl
What is speech shadowing and why is it used?,"Used in attention research, this refers to having participants echo information that is presented in one ear, and ignore information presented in the other ear",ON,bl
What is dichotic listening and why is it used?,"Used in attention research, this refers to any situation wherein two different streams of auditory information are presented simultaneously, one in each ear",ON,bl
What is automaticity?,"A case in which something has been done so many times, it can now be accomplished effortlessly and automatically without much conscious effort",ON,bl
What are action slips?,Action slips are errors made during automatic processing,ON,bl
What is the difference between dendrites and axons?,"Dendrites receive information from neighboring neurons, whereas axons send signals to neighboring neurons",ON,bl
What is the corpus callosum?,Refers to the thick bundle of fibers connecting the left and right hemispheres of the brain,ON,bl
What is the Law of Common Fate?,a tendency to group elements together if they are moving in the same direction or at the same speed,ON,bl
What is attentional blink?,refractory period wherein new information cannot be detected,ON,bl
What is attentional capture?,"attention is involuntarily drawn to something (e.g., a lightning bolt in the sky)",ON,bl
What is the word length effect?,the finding that short-term memory span is negatively related to the length of encoded items,ON,bl
What is proactive versus retroactive interference?,"Proactive interference occurs when earlier information interferes with the ability to retain information that comes later, whereas retroactive interference occurs when later information interferes with the ability to retain information that came earlier ",ON,bl
What is the primacy effect?,tendency to remember the earliest items in a presented list especially well,ON,bl
What is the recency effect?,tendency to remember the latest items in a presented list especially well,ON,bl
What is the Brown-Peterson Task?,"a sequence of letters is encoded, followed by a distraction task of counting backward, followed by recall of the letter sequence",ON,bl
"What did McNamara, Long, and Wike (1956) discover?",discovered that learning can occur without responding,ON,bl
What were the main findings of Tolman and Honzik (1930)?,found that learning can occur without reinforcement; latent learning,ON,bl
What were the results of Navon (1977)?,"discovered the global precedence effect, which refers to a tendency to encode the overall features of a scene before apprehending scene details ",ON,bl
"What were the main results of Greenwald et al., (1991)?","investigated subliminal perception by having participants listen to subliminal audio recordings and found that although there were perceived differences, no actual improvement came from listening to the tapes",ON,bl
What is Logan (1988) associated with?,"instance-based view of automaticity, which claims that instances are stored and we switch from deliberate to retrieval-based processing",ON,bl
What is Schneider and Shiffrin (1977) associated with?,"increased speed approach of automaticity, which claims that we simply get faster over time at completing the same tasks",ON,bl
What were the results of Corteen and Wood (1972)?,showed that participants responded to stimuli in the unattended ear if it had been paired with shock earlier in the experiment,ON,bl
What were the main findings from Brooks (1968)?,"found evidence that there are two separate subsystems within working memory, one of which handles verbal information, and the other which handles spatial information",ON,bl
What did Ebbinghaus investigate?,investigated the rate of forgetting following the relearning of non-sense syllables,ON,bl
What did Bartlett investigate and how was it different than Ebbinghaus?,"Bartlett also investigated memory, but Bartlett used more authentic learning materials (e.g., texts) compared to Ebbinghaus, who only investigated memory for non-sense syllables",ON,bl
