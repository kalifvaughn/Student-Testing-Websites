Cue,Answer,Shuffle,Stimuli Notes
What is natural selection?,The process whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring. ,ON,bl
Who suggested natural selection?,Charles Darwin,ON,bl
What factors might influence the process of natural selection?,"Any factors that could potentially lead to a survival advantage for one species versus another (e.g., speed, ability to survive in a particular climate or type of terrain, etc.).",ON,bl
"What is the ""Theory of Acquired Inheritance""?","Animals can develop desirable traits based solely on ""inner needs"" and ""desires"" to obtain those traits. ",ON,bl
What is a reflex?,"A relationship between a specific event and a simple, response to that event. ",ON,bl
What is a modal action pattern?,A series of related acts found in all or nearly all members of a species. ,ON,bl
What is a general behavior trait?,Any general behavioral tendency that is strongly influenced by genes. Examples include introversion and general anxiety. ,ON,bl
"What is meant by ""nature versus nurture""?","Nature refers to genetic factors, whereas nurture refers to environmental factors. Both are important in development.",ON,bl
What is a mutation?,"Any abrupt change in a gene. When the modified gene occurs in a reproductive cell, the mutation may be passed on to offspring.",ON,bl
What is learning?,A change in behavior due to experience.,ON,bl
What is habituation?,A decrease in the intensity or probability of a reflex response resulting from repeated exposure to a stimulus that evokes that response. ,ON,bl
What were the results of Tolman and Honzik (1930)?,"Tolman and Honzik (1930) placed rats in a maze and either rewarded them each time they reached the end, never rewarded them, or rewarded them when they reached the end but only starting on Day 11. The main findings were that the rats were learning the entire time they were roaming around the maze; however, this was not apparent until reinforcement was introduced. The rats that were only reinforced starting on Day 11 had learned just as much as the continously reinforced rats. This is an example of ""latent learning"".",ON,bl
What were the results of Hull (1943)?,"Hull (1943) had rats push a lever that required 21 grams of force (which lead to a food reward). Next, he increased the amount of force required to push the lever to 38 grams of force. The rats increased their intensity to 38 grams of force in order to receive the food reward.",ON,bl
What is a between-subjects design?,An experimental design in which the independent variable is made to vary across two or more groups of subjects. ,ON,bl
What is a within-participants design?,A research design in which the independent variable is made to vary at different times for the same subject.,ON,bl
What is internal validity?,"How well an experiment is done, especially whether it avoids confounds.",ON,bl
What is external validity?,The extent to which the results of a study can be generalized to other situations and to other people or animals.,ON,bl
What is fluency?,A measure of learning consisting of the number of correct responses per minute. ,ON,bl
What is latency?,The time that passes between an event and a behavior.,ON,bl
What is topography?,The change in movement that occurs during a task.,ON,bl
What is an unconditional stimulus (UCS)?,A stimulus that elicits an unconditional response.,ON,bl
What is an unconditional response (UCR)?,The reflex response elicited by an unconditional stimulus.,ON,bl
What is a condtional stimulus (CS)?,The stimulus part of a conditional reflex; the stimulus that elicits a conditional response. ,ON,bl
What is a conditional response (CR)?,The response elicited by a conditional stimulus. ,ON,bl
What is trace conditioning?,A Pavlovian conditioning procedure in which the CS begins and ends before the US is presented.,ON,bl
What is delay conditioning?,"A Pavlovian conditioning procedure in which the CS and US overlap. The CS is presented before the US, but continues after the US appears.",ON,bl
What is backwards conditioning?,A Pavlovian conditioning procedure in which the US precedes the CS.,ON,bl
"What is ""pseudoconditioning""?",The tendency of a neutral stimulus to elicit a CR when presented after a US has elicited a reflex response.,ON,bl
What is higher-order conditioning?," A variation of Pavlovian conditioning in which a neutral stimulus is paired, not with a US, but with a well-established CS.",ON,bl
What is Rescorla (1968)?,"Rescorla (1968) manipulated contingency with a tone following a shock in rats. For Group 1, the tone was followed by shock 90% of the time. For Group 2, 80%. And for Group 3, the tone was followed by shock only 60% of the time. The results suggested that less learning occurred as contingency between tone and shock decreased. Thus, Group 3 learned the least and Group 1 learned the association the best.",ON,bl
"What is ""latent inhibition""?","In Pavlovian conditioning, the failure of a CR to appear as a result of prior presentation of the CS in the absence of the US.",ON,bl
What is an independent variable?,"In an experiment, the variable that the researcher manipulates. ",ON,bl
What is a dependent variable?,The variable by which the outcome of an experiment is measured. ,ON,bl
What is contingency?,A dependency between events. ,ON,bl
What is contiguity?,Nearness of events in time (temporal contiguity) or space (spatial contiguity).,ON,bl
"What is ""extinction""?"," In Pavlovian conditioning, the regular appearance of the CS alone (i.e., without the US).",ON,bl
"What is ""spontaneous recovery""?",The sudden reappearance of a behavior following its extinction.,ON,bl
"What is the ""Rescorla-Wagner Model"" of classical conditioning?","The ""Rescorla-Wagner Model"" is a mathematical model to explain how much learning can occur on any particular trial during conditioning. The model accounts for levels of prior learning.",ON,bl
"What is the ""Stimulus Substitution Theory"" of classical conditioning?","In classical conditioning, the theory that the CS substitutes for the US. It assumes that the CR is essentially the same as the UR.",ON,bl
What are the results of Lightfoot (1980)?,"Lightfoot (1980) had participants drink beer for 30 minutes on 5 occasions. The first four days were at Location A, whereas the fifth day was either Location A or Location B (a novel location). On IQ and motor tests, participants performed much worse if they were in a novel location compared to a familiar one.  The novel location made them ""drunker"", because environments serve as a familiar cue during learning. These results help support Compensatory Response Theory.",ON,bl
"What is ""blocking""?",Failure of a stimulus to become a CS when it is part of a compound stimulus that includes an effective CS. The effective CS is said to block the formation of a new CS. ,ON,bl
"What is ""sensory preconditioning""?","A procedure in which two neutral stimuli are paired, after which one is repeatedly paired with a US. If the other stimulus is then presented alone, it may elicit a CR even though it was never paired with the US.",ON,bl
"Who was ""Little Albert"" and why was he important?","""Little Albert"" was a small child that was conditioned to fear white rats. This highlighted the importance of environment and experiences in the development of behaviors and fears (which were previously thought to be hereditary and part of our genetics).",ON,bl
"What is ""counterconditioning""?",The use of Pavlovian conditioning to reverse the unwanted effects of prior conditioning. ,ON,bl
"What is ""systematic desensitization""?",A form of counterconditioning in which a patient imagines progressively troubling scenes while relaxed.,ON,bl
What does Kiviat (2007) suggest about brand loyalty?,"Kiviat (2007) had participants taste peanut butter from unlabeled jars, except for one which had a brand name label on it. Even though the peanut butter was the same brand within each jar, 75% of participants claimed that the name brand version tasted best.",ON,bl
What were the results of Siegel (1982)?,"Siegel (1982) gave rats a strong dose of heroin in either a familiar context or a novel context. The major finding was that those rats receiving the heroin in a familiar context had a lower chance of dying from the heroin. In contrast, those rats receiving the heroin in a novel context were much more likely to die from the heroin. This study highlights the fact that the context in which drug use occurs is very important in how the body responds to the drug.",ON,bl
"What were the main results from Russell et al., (1984)?","Russell et al., (1984) gave guinea pigs BSA (a protein) and made them allergic to it. Then, they presented BSA + a strong sulfur smell. They discovered that the sulfur smell was sufficient to elicit histamine production, suggesting that allergic reactions can be learned through conditioning.",ON,bl
